- Hi, I am Paulo, but you can call me lpa2. I'm a college student from Brazil who's been learning programming since 2017.
- Since then I improved a lot and I will not stop. I love computers and programming so much and I am just getting started.
- I have a lot of projects in my cloud drives, some finished, most unfinished or unstarted. I will keep them there for now.
- When the best of these projects are ready I shall create a repo on GitHub for them.
- But neither I nor them are ready for that now, so I will wait some more time.
- That's it... See you later.<br>
